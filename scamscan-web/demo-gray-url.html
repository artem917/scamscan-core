    <h1>Networked AI portfolio manager</h1>
    <p class="hero-note">
        This <strong>demo landing page</strong> is intentionally written to look like a
        high-yield product without being a direct scam. It is hosted by ScamScan and does
        not advertise any real service.
    </p>

    <div class="risk-copy">
        <p>
            Our <span class="highlight">automated trading bot</span> connects to multiple
            exchanges through a single <strong>investment platform</strong> interface.
            The goal is to generate <strong>passive income</strong> over time while the
            system rebalances your portfolio in the background.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users choose from several experimental strategies with different risk levels.
            Returns are variable and depend on market conditions; results are not
            guaranteed and balances can go down as well as up.
        </p>
        <h2>Social layer</h2>
        <p>
            Members can share access codes with people they trust. When invited contacts
            activate a strategy, the original member may receive a small fee share —
            essentially a way to <strong>invite friends and earn</strong> together inside
            the same ecosystem.
        </p>
        <h2>Why this page exists</h2>
        <p>
            Many borderline products combine terms such as <em>investment platform</em>,
            <em>trading bot</em>, <em>passive income</em> and <em>invite friends and earn</em>
            to suggest low-effort profit without clearly explaining the risks.
            ScamScan uses pages like this as <strong>gray-area examples</strong> for testing
            content risk models and explaining why a URL may look risky even if it is not a
            classic credential-stealing scam.

        This is a non-functional example used for educational and testing purposes. It is not an offer
        to invest, trade or deposit funds. Any similarity to real projects is coincidental.
